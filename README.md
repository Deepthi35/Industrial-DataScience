Assignment1

Numpy, pandas and mathlib operations.

Problem Satement :
 1. use numpy to perform basic mathematical operations on arrays(e.g. multiplications,addition,etc)
 2. Practice data manipulation tasks using Pandas as filtering rows,computing summaru statistics, and merging datasets.
 3. create a data visulaization using matplotlib to represent a dataset of your choice.
 4. write a short report on the benfits and advantages of using numpy,pandas and matplotlib in data analysis and visualization.

Assignment2

1. choose a dataset of your choice and perform data manipulation tasks using pandas (e.g,filtering,sorting,aggregating)
2. create different visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to explore the dataset.
3. conduct EDA(exploratory data analysis ) on a given dataset and generate summary statistics, visualizations, and insights
4. write a short report on the significance of data manipulation, visulaization, and analysis in extracting from data
